# Statistical Rethinking (2nd ed.) with Pyro
In an attempt to learn Bayesian modelling from [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/), I decided to redo all the code examples using pyro.

## Why `Pyro`?
I'm pythonic and have been working with `pytorch` lately.  `pyro` is built on top of `pytorch` and seems like a natural choice for Bayesian inference. Plus, implementing things from scratch teaches you way more than using black-box functions.
